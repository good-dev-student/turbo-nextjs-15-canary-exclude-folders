## New Features

### ðŸŽ‰ xata-http driver support

According their **[official website](https://xata.io)**, Xata is a Postgres data platform with a focus on reliability, scalability, and developer experience. The Xata Postgres service is currently in beta, please see the [Xata docs](https://xata.io/docs/postgres) on how to enable it in your account.

Drizzle ORM natively supports both the `xata` driver with `drizzle-orm/xata` package and the **`postgres`** or **`pg`** drivers for accessing a Xata Postgres database.

The following example use the Xata generated client, which you obtain by running the [xata init](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/installation) CLI command.

<Npm>
drizzle-orm @xata.io/client
-D drizzle-kit
</Npm>

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/xata-http';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();
const db = drizzle(xata);

const result = await db.select().from(...);
```

You can also connect to Xata using `pg` or `postgres.js` drivers

To get started with Xata and Drizzle follow the [documentation](/docs/get-started-postgresql#xata).
